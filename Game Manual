The game starts automatically upon loading; after all enemies from a wave
are killed the next wave will start 2 seconds later.

Left clicking a black tile (wall) will place the selected rune on that spot
Right clicking a rune will sell the rune at half price.

You can select different runes from the sidebar on the right. Each rune has
next to it it's name, cost and secondary effect.

Each rune has a buff effect on all runes it's placed next to, this effect
is removed when it's sold. Effects are applied only to runes already in
existence when the new rune is placed, runes placed subsequently are not
effected but also lose no effect if the first rune is removed.

After each wave you are given a reward in gold in addition to the 1 gold
given to build more runes with. After each level all runes are removed
and the amount of gold given is set to the new amount (varies per level).
