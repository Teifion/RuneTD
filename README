Just like any other TD except that your towers are built from runes, each gives stats and effects. Get the balance right and you're good to go.

Dependancies:
    Python 2.6.1
    PyGame

This is my 2nd PyGame project and I wanted to have something where I could have a "Game engine" that handled all the user-input side of things and another part of the program handle the actual rules. This'd allow me to reuse some of the first part of the code in later games.

The features I want the engine to have are:
    Handle keyboard and mouse input
    Display game objects based on the game logic rather than having to display everything
    Using the pygame sprites

The features I'd like to have but may leave out of this version of the engine:
    In game menus
